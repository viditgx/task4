# Task 4: Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

Welcome to **Task 4** of my Data Science internship project. In this task, I focused on performing predictive analysis using various machine learning algorithms. This repository includes the code, datasets, and outputs related to predictive modeling.

## 🔍 Project Objective

To build and evaluate multiple machine learning models for predictive analysis on a given dataset, interpret the results, and improve model performance using data preprocessing and tuning techniques.
